# DirectoryTracer

## Author: Justin Bornais

This is a simple Python script used for tracing a directory and creating index.html webpages in each folder and subfolder, displaying the contents of each directory. This is beneficial for people who want to host a file server online, and it even works for GitHub Pages.

In order to run this code, you must have Python installed. Simply copy the <code>trace.py</code> file into your directory you want, or simply fork this repository. You do not have to edit the file whatsoever, as it will go by <code>os.curdir</code>.

Then, simply run <code>trace.py</code> by typing <code>python trace.py</code> or <code>py trace.py</code> and your webpages should be automatically created!
